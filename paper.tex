% some very useful LaTeX packages include:

%\usepackage{cite}      % Written by Donald Arseneau
                        % V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format
                        % of the cite.sty package \cite{} output to follow
                        % that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

%\usepackage{psfrag}    % Written by Craig Barratt, Michael C. Grant,
                        % and David Carlisle
                        % This package allows you to substitute LaTeX
                        % commands for text in imported EPS graphic files.
                        % In this way, LaTeX symbols can be placed into
                        % graphics that have been generated by other

                        % workflow (not direct pdf output from pdflatex) if
                        % you wish to use this capability because it works
                        % via some PostScript tricks. Alternatively, the
                        % graphics could be processed as separate files via
                        % psfrag and dvips, then converted to PDF for
                        % inclusion in the main file which uses pdflatex.

%\usepackage{stfloats}  % Written by Sigitas Tolusis
                        % Gives LaTeX2e the ability to do double column

                        % possible in LaTeX2e). This is an invasive package
                        % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e output
                        % routines. It may not work with other packages that

                        % IEEE does not allow \baselineskip to stretch.
                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.
                        % Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or
                        % midfloat.sty package (by the same author) as IEEE
                        % does not format its papers in such ways.

\usepackage{amsmath}    % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands
                        % for dealing with mathematics. Note that the AMSmath
                        % package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus
                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
                        % and documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/
\usepackage{bm}


% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.

% Also of notable interest:
% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
\PARstart{T}{his} section introduces the problem to solved and leads the reader on to the main part. Detailed motivation is necessary. What's more, you can show your expected results and contributions.

% Main Part
\section{Methods and Theory}
In this section, you are asked to give a complete introduction to the experiment. For instance, the chosen methods, the related theories, the related equations(loss function), the derivation process(taking the gradient) and so on.

We could introduce a regularizer to prevent over-fitting, such as:
\begin{equation}
\bm{L}_{D}(w) = \frac{\lambda}{2}{||\bm{w}||}^{2}_{2} + \frac{1}{2}{||\bm{y-Xw}||^2_{2}}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is called trade-off parameter or regularization parameter.

The intuition behind the closed-form solution is to find a $\bm{w}$ that satisfied the equation as follows:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \bm{L}(w)}{\partial \bm{w}} = 0
\end{equation}
After calculating, we find the best $\bm{w}$:
\begin{equation}\label{con:bestw}
\bm{w} = (\bm{X^TX}+\lambda \bm{I})^{-1}\bm{X}^{T}\bm{y} 
\end{equation}

In experiments, we just implement the equation \eqref{con:bestw} step by step.

Gradient descent is another good method to find the optimal $\bm{w}$. Gradient descent is based on the observation that if the multi-variable function $\bm{F(x)}$ is defined and differentiable in a neighborhood of a point $\bm{a}$ , then $\bm{F(x)}$ decreases fastest if one goes from $\bm{a}$ in the direction of the negative gradient of $\bm{F}$ at $\bm{a}$ , $-\nabla \bm{F(a)}$. For linear regression, we use $d = - \frac{\partial \bm{L}_{D}(\bm{w})}{\partial \bm{w}}$ as the direction of optimization. We update parameters with rate $\eta$ as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{con:gg}
\bm{w}^{'} \rightarrow \bm{w} - \eta \frac{\partial \bm{L}_{D}(\bm{w})}{\partial \bm{w}}
\end{equation}
We implement this statement \eqref{con:gg} iteratively till convergence. We should pay attention to the parameter $\eta$ , because it has a large impact on convergence. If $\eta$ is too large, the result may be oscillatory or even diverge, if $\eta$ is too small, the convergence speed will slow up.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Dataset}
This section represents the related information of datasets, such as the content, the number of data, the training set, the validation set and so on.

This project uses Housing dataset in LIBSVM Data, including 506 samples and each sample has 13 features. You are expected to download scaled edition. After downloading, you are supposed to divide it into training set, validation set.

\subsection{Implementation}
All detailed implementation in your experiment: initialization, process, results, all kinds of parameters. In a word, describe clearly What you do and how you do.\par

	% You can reference tables and figure by using the \ref{label} command. Each table and figure needs to have a UNIQUE label.
	Figures and tables should be labeled and numbered, such as in Table~\ref{tab:simParameters} and Fig.~\ref{fig:tf_plot}.

	% This is how you define a table: the [!hbt] means that LaTeX is forced (by the !) to place the table exactly here (by h), or if that doesnt work because of a pagebreak or so, it tries to place the table to the bottom of the page (by b) or the top (by t).
	\begin{table}[!hbt]
		% Center the table
		\begin{center}
		% Title of the table
		\caption{Simulation Parameters}
		\label{tab:simParameters}
		% Table itself: here we have two columns which are centered and have lines to the left, right and in the middle: |c|c|
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			% To create a horizontal line, type \hline
			\hline
			% To end a column type &
			% For a linebreak type \\
			Information message length & $k=16000$ bit \\
			\hline
			Radio segment size & $b=160$ bit \\
			\hline
			Rate of component codes & $R_{cc}=1/3$\\
			\hline
			Polynomial of component encoders & $[1 , 33/37 , 25/37]_8$\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}

	% If you have questions about how to write mathematical formulas in LaTeX, please read a LaTeX book or the 'Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX': tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

	% This is how you include a eps figure in your document. LaTeX only accepts EPS or TIFF files.
	\begin{figure}[!hbt]
		% Center the figure.
		\begin{center}
		% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{plot_tf}
		% Create a subtitle for the figure.
		\caption{Simulation results on the AWGN channel. Average throughput $k/n$ vs $E_s/N_0$.}
		% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
		\label{fig:tf_plot}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}
