                        % that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX

\usepackage{bm}



% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the

% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.

% Also of notable interest:
% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% Write abstract here
\begin{abstract}
The theme of this project is to have a deeper understanding of linear regression, closed-form solution and stochastic gradient descent.

\section{Introduction}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
\PARstart{T}{here} is a simple and traditional model called linear regression, which describes the linear relationship between a response variable and one or more predictor variables. We have two methods to achieve this model, one is closed-form solution, and the other is stochastic gradient descent. This project aims to implement these two methods by python and numpy, and conduct some experiments under a small scale dataset. The experimental results on the small scale dataset show that linear regression has a good imitative effect.

% Main Part
\section{Methods and Theory}
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. Linear regression plays and important role in the field of machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms. \par

We denote $X$ as the input, and $Y$ as the output. Our goal is to learn a hypothesis function $f: X \rightarrow Y$. The linear regression function is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  f(\bm{x};w_0,\bm{w}) & = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2+...+w_mx_m \\ & = \sum_{j=1}^{m}w_jx_j + w_0 \\ & = \bm{w}^{T}\bm{x} + w_{0}   
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\bm{w}$ and $w_0$ represents the parameters in this equation, $m$ represents the number of features in $X$. We use a loss function to measure the "goodness" of a linear regression model. In this project, we use least square loss function, which is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \bm{L}_{D}(w) & = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^{n}{(y_i - f(x_i;\bm{w}))}^2 \\ & = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^{n}{(y_i - \bm{w}^T)x_i}^2 \\ & = \frac{1}{2}(\bm{y-Xw})^T(\bm{y-Xw})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Our goal is to find the best "$\bm{w}$" which could minimize the least squared loss. 
\begin{equation}
  \bm{w}^{*} = \mathop{\arg\min}_{\bm{w}}L_{D}(w)
\end{equation}

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Dataset}
This section represents the related information of datasets, such as the content, the number of data, the training set, the validation set and so on.

\subsection{Implementation}
All detailed implementation in your experiment: initialization, process, results, all kinds of parameters. In a word, describe clearly What you do and how you do.\par

	% You can reference tables and figure by using the \ref{label} command. Each table and figure needs to have a UNIQUE label.
	Figures and tables should be labeled and numbered, such as in Table~\ref{tab:simParameters} and Fig.~\ref{fig:tf_plot}.

	% This is how you define a table: the [!hbt] means that LaTeX is forced (by the !) to place the table exactly here (by h), or if that doesnt work because of a pagebreak or so, it tries to place the table to the bottom of the page (by b) or the top (by t).
	\begin{table}[!hbt]
		% Center the table
		\begin{center}
		% Title of the table
		\caption{Simulation Parameters}
		\label{tab:simParameters}
		% Table itself: here we have two columns which are centered and have lines to the left, right and in the middle: |c|c|
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			% To create a horizontal line, type \hline
			\hline
			% To end a column type &
			% For a linebreak type \\
			Information message length & $k=16000$ bit \\
			\hline
			Radio segment size & $b=160$ bit \\
			\hline
			Rate of component codes & $R_{cc}=1/3$\\
			\hline
			Polynomial of component encoders & $[1 , 33/37 , 25/37]_8$\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}

	% If you have questions about how to write mathematical formulas in LaTeX, please read a LaTeX book or the 'Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX': tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

	% This is how you include a eps figure in your document. LaTeX only accepts EPS or TIFF files.
	\begin{figure}[!hbt]
		% Center the figure.
		\begin{center}
		% Include the eps file, scale it such that it's width equals the column width. You can also put width=8cm for example...
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{plot_tf}
		% Create a subtitle for the figure.
		\caption{Simulation results on the AWGN channel. Average throughput $k/n$ vs $E_s/N_0$.}
		% Define the label of the figure. It's good to use 'fig:title', so you know that the label belongs to a figure.
		\label{fig:tf_plot}
		\end{center}
